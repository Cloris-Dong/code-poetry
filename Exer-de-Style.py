A # NOTE:
Exercises in Style (French: Exercices de style) is my fav buk written by Raymond Queneau.
This buk is a collection of 99 retellings of the same story, each in a different style.
In each, the narrator gets on the "S" bus,
witnesses an altercation between a young man with a long neck and funny hat and another passenger,
and then sees the same person two hours later in the Cour de Rome at the Gare St-Lazare getting advice on adding a button to his overcoat.

In this assignment, I hope to create the 100th retelling of the story in the form of code poetry.

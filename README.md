![mez breeze](https://d1v7jayx2s9clc.cloudfront.net/user/pages/08.mez-breeze/Screen%20Shot%202016-12-15%20at%2012.54.52%20PM.png)

before forking this repo, make sure that u've read the [open source](https://netart.rocks/uchicago/netart2/open-source.html) notes i put together on our class website. also, try && watch as many of the videos in the playlist i curated as well (at the bottom of the open source notes).

then [take a look at the video tutorials i made on git + github](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoQrXDiSBWYGFfbXdY55DfpyZyZavjSAz), there i discuss some new media theory related to versioning + also share some early text based net culture + i also demonstrate different ways to use git (on GitHub, in Atom && in the terminal).

once u've done that go ahead && fork this repo && create ur own piece of "code poetry" (at least one file which u add to ur fork of this repo). as i mention in the last of the git/github video tutorials, there are two goals w/this assignment:

1. to make sure we're all comfortable forking repos && pushing up our changes. this is important b/c it is how we'll be submitting all of our assignments this quarter.

2. to see our code in a new light, not merely as instructions to the computer but as an aesthetic space for creative expression itself.

take a look at the `mez.txt` file as an example, this is a piece of email code poetry by early net artist [Mez Breeze](https://anthology.rhizome.org/mez-breeze) (which i also discussed in the video tutorials). consider how she plays w/code+language to make her poetry. Consider too some of [Shawn√© Michaelain Holloway](https://www.shawnemichaelainholloway.com/)'s code poetry prompts which i mentioned in the video:

- Where are there opportunities for subtext?
- Were can I use the structure of the code to make it more poetic?
- How can elements like order or style or color names or variables help me tell my story? 
- How can I utilize comments or syntax?
